# window_commands

**Quick links:** [itch.io page](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gamemaker-window-commands)

This extension allows to do a number of things:

* Allows to minimize/maximize/restore the window on demand.
* Allows to disable/enable minimize button, maximize button, close button, and window movement.
* Allows to override behaviour for when minimize/maximize/close buttons are clicked.

The extension makes use of WinAPI-specific hooks and thus is tightly tied to Windows.
